# ufw-php-gui
Linux UFW Web PHP GUI Project

In 2018 I've started with my first web service project on a virtual hosted linux server which was accessible and unprotected from outside (INET) and so I decided to protect the hosted server with the universal firewall (UFW) to allow/restrict and deny network traffic. 

To be more flexible to configure the universal firewall (UFW) I decided to start developing shell scripts and php forms which can be used as a simple frontend GUI.

Of course this stage of development has big potential to be improved, corrected and enhanced. You're welcome to contribute to make from the idea - this stage of development a great useable PHP frontend GUI for the UFW (Universal Firewall).
